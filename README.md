=============

Tampermonkey Helper for Pass The Parcel couriers (New Zealand)

Improves the indication of address detection to make it clearer when Pass The Parcel might have detected the address incorrectly.

Replaces the static image map with a proper embedded google map.

Example of an incorrect address detection, the customer supplied an address in Stratford (Taranaki), Pass The Parcel thinks it is in Greenlane Auckland, notice how the script makes it much more obvious that this is the case by including in red the area which Pass The Parcel thinks it is, but which are not written anywhere in the original address.

Example of a correct address, notice how the parts of the address that Pass The Parcel "recognised" have been highlighted in green in the original address.

Notice in both how there is a proper google map which can be panned and zoomed, and a link to view it in google maps if you need to further check (eg for Street View).
